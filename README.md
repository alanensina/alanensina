# Hello everybody!

### Who am I?
<p>Hi! I'm Alan â€” a Brazilian software developer currently based in Dublin, Ireland. I'm passionate about building scalable, high-performance applications, with a strong focus on Java and backend technologies. I specialize in frameworks like Spring Boot for developing microservices and APIs.

<p>I hold a degree in Information Systems, as well as qualifications in Human Resources and an MBA in People Management. This unique blend of technical expertise and people-oriented education allows me to understand both code and collaboration â€” making me an effective team player and leader.

<p>I'm always excited to learn, explore new technologies, and contribute to innovative projects. Letâ€™s connect and create something amazing together! ðŸš€
