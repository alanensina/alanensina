### Who am I?
Hi! I'm Alan, Software developer, Brazilian living in Dublin/Ireland. I'm a passionate software developer with a strong focus on Java and backend technologies. I enjoy building scalable and efficient applications, leveraging frameworks like Spring Boot for microservices and API development.
With a formal education in Information Systems, along with degrees in Human Resources and an MBA in People Management, I combine technical expertise with a strong understanding of team dynamics and leadership.
I'm always eager to learn, experiment with new technologies, and contribute to innovative projects. Let's connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€
